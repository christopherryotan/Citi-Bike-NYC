    "text": "2. Data Sources & Acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGoal:\nConstruct a daily, Manhattan-focused panel that links Citi Bike ridership to local weather conditions using fully reproducible data pipelines.\n\n\n\n2.1 Data Sources\n\nCiti Bike Data\nCiti Bike trip data provide near-census coverage of all trips taken on the system during the study period (October 2024 through October 2025). Each trip record includes timestamps, start and end locations, and rider type indicators, allowing trips to be aggregated reliably to the daily level.\n\n\nOpen-Meteo API\nDaily weather data are obtained from the Open-Meteo archive API and include mean daily temperature and total daily precipitation. Observations are drawn from a central Manhattan location to provide a consistent approximation of weather conditions experienced by riders across the borough.\nWeather variables are measured at the daily level to match the temporal resolution of aggregated trip counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhy these data work together\nCiti Bike data capture what riders do, while weather data capture the conditions under which those decisions are made. Linking the two allows us to estimate how short-term conditions translate into changes in demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Data Acquisition Code\nAll data are acquired programmatically to ensure reproducibility and transparency.\n\nTrip data ingestion\nCiti Bike trip files are downloaded directly from the official system S3 repository on a month-by-month basis. Downloads are wrapped in retry logic with incremental backoff to guard against transient network failures. Files are retrieved only if they are not already present locally, avoiding unnecessary re-downloads.\nTrip files are read using a targeted column selection to reduce memory usage and improve processing speed.\n\n\nSpatial filtering\nManhattan is defined using an official NYC borough boundary shapefile obtained from the NYC Department of City Planning. The geometry is transformed to a standard WGS84 coordinate reference system and used to filter trips via a GIS point-in-polygon operation.\nOnly trips whose starting coordinates fall within the Manhattan boundary are retained. This spatial filtering approach avoids reliance on station naming conventions and ensures consistent geographic classification across all months.\n\n\nWeather data ingestion\nWeather data are retrieved via parameterized API requests specifying location, date range, units, and time zone. API responses are validated before being converted into a structured daily dataset containing temperature and precipitation measures.\n\n\nCaching and reuse\nAll intermediate and final datasets are saved as compressed RDS files. This design allows downstream analyses to load clean, analysis-ready data without repeating download or cleaning steps, ensuring both efficiency and reproducibility across scripts.\n\nResulting dataset\nA clean, spatially accurate, daily panel linking Manhattan-origin Citi Bike trips to local weather conditions, suitable for exploratory analysis and non-linear modeling."

Data Cleaning, Preparation & Exploration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGoal of this section:\nPrepare a clean, spatially accurate, and analysis-ready dataset that reflects rider decision-making at the start of each Citi Bike trip.\n\n\n\n3.1 Cleaning & Preparation\n\nDefining the spatial scope\nTo ensure precise geographic filtering, Manhattan was defined using an official NYC borough boundary shapefile. The geometry was transformed to the WGS84 coordinate reference system to better align with the latitude and longitude values reported in the Citi Bike data.\nThis GIS-based definition avoids reliance on station names or borough labels, which may be incomplete or inconsistently reported, and instead grounds spatial filtering in geometry.\n\n\nImporting and standardizing trip data\nTrip data were downloaded month-by-month and processed using a consistent directory structure to support reproducibility. For each CSV file, only variables required for analysis were imported, reducing memory overhead and keeping the dataset focused.\nTrip start and end times were converted to timezone-aware datetime objects using local New York time. From these timestamps, additional temporal variables, such as date and hour, were derived to support daily aggregation and exploratory analysis.\n\n\nHandling missing and invalid records\nTrips with missing starting latitude or longitude were excluded prior to spatial filtering, as geographic classification requires valid coordinate information. This step removes records that cannot be reliably assigned to a borough.\n\n\nGIS-based Manhattan filtering\nStarting coordinates were converted into spatial point objects and evaluated using a point-in-polygon operation against the Manhattan boundary. Only trips whose starting location fell within Manhattan were retained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy filter on trip start?\nRider decisions are made at the beginning of a trip. As such, we ultimately decided that restricting our analysis to trips that start in Manhattan reflects demand originating from within the borough, rather than trips that merely pass through or end there.\n\n\n\n\nDataset consolidation and storage\nCleaned trips were combined across CSV chunks within each month, then concatenated across all months into a single dataset spanning October 2024 through October 2025. The resulting dataset was then saved as a compressed RDS file to enable for fast loading and consistent reuse in subsequent steps."

    "text": "4. Analytical Strategy\nDaily trip counts are modeled as a function of weather using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Preliminary exploration revealed strong departures from linearity in the relationship between temperature and ridership, motivating the use of flexible smooth terms rather than parametric regression.\nGAMs allow the data to determine functional form while maintaining interpretability. Smoothness is constrained to avoid overfitting, and model adequacy is assessed using effective degrees of freedom and deviance explained. This approach balances flexibility with transparency and is well-suited to isolating weather-driven demand effects."

Ridership increases rapidly as temperatures rise from cold to mild conditions, but marginal gains diminish at higher temperatures, indicating a comfort threshold beyond which additional warmth does not increase demand.\nPrecipitation reduces ridership in an asymmetric manner. Light rain has limited impact on typical daily usage, while moderate to heavy rainfall leads to substantial declines in trip volume, particularly in the upper tail of the distribution.\n\n\n5.2 Robustness / Validation"

Discussion\n\n7.1 Answer\n\n\n7.2 Contribution to the OQ\nThis weather-focused analysis makes an irreplaceable contribution to the overarching question by separating short-run demand suppression from longer-run structural determinants of ridership. Without explicitly modeling non-linear weather effects, analyses of time-of-day patterns, rider type, or infrastructure risk attributing weather-driven fluctuations to persistent system features. By isolating these effects, this report provides a necessary baseline against which other project components can be interpreted."

    "text": "Specific Questions (SQs)\n\nSQ1: What are the most popular bike routes and resting stops?\nThis question identifies where Citi Bike trips most often begin, end, and connect. By examining popular routes and high-traffic stations, we can see how riders move through Manhattan and which locations consistently experience high demand. This provides spatial context for the rest of the analysis.\n\n\nSQ2: How do temperature and precipitation affect ridership activity?\nWeather influences whether people choose to ride. Warmer temperatures generally encourage biking, while rain tends to reduce trip volume. This SQ isolates the effect of weather to understand how much it shifts overall ridership levels across days and seasons.\n\n\nSQ3: How does rider type influence both demand and riding patterns?\nMembers and casual riders use Citi Bike for different purposes. Members often ride for commuting, while casual riders are more likely to ride for leisure. This SQ helps explain who is driving ridership changes and how usage patterns differ across rider groups.\n\n\nSQ4: Is station ridership higher near protected lanes than shared lanes?\nBike lane design may affect where riders feel comfortable starting trips. Protected lanes often provide greater safety than shared lanes. This SQ examines whether stations closer to protected infrastructure experience higher ridership compared to those near shared lanes.\n\n\nSQ5: How does time of day and day of week impact overall ridership trends?\nCiti Bike usage follows clear daily and weekly cycles. Commute hours create weekday peaks, while weekends show different patterns. This SQ establishes the temporal structure of demand and helps explain when the system is most heavily used.\n\n\nSQ6: How does station infrastructure relate to e-bike versus classic bike usage?\nDifferent types of infrastructure may influence the choice between e-bikes and classic bikes. This SQ explores whether proximity to certain lane types or station characteristics is associated with higher e-bike usage compared to classic bikes."

    "section": "Engagement with Prior Literature",
    "text": "Engagement with Prior Literature\nPrior research on bike-sharing systems consistently shows that infrastructure, environmental conditions, and rider behavior all play important roles in shaping ridership. However, much of the existing literature tends to examine these factors separately or at a broad system level. This project builds on prior work by bringing these elements together and applying them to a focused, station-level analysis within Manhattan.\n\nProtected Bike Lanes and Ridership (2025)\nEffect of Protected Bike Lanes on Bike-Sharing Ridership\nOne recent study, Effect of Protected Bike Lanes on Bike-Sharing Ridership (2025), examines whether protected bike lanes lead to increased Citi Bike usage. Using a causal research design and several years of system-wide data, the authors find that ridership increases after protected lanes are installed. Their results provide strong evidence that safer infrastructure can encourage more people to use bike-share systems. However, the analysis focuses on overall ridership changes rather than how usage varies at individual stations. The study also does not incorporate weather conditions, making it difficult to separate the effects of infrastructure from environmental factors. As a result, while the findings support the importance of protected lanes, they leave open questions about how these effects play out in dense areas like Manhattan at a more detailed spatial level.\n\n\nUrban Environment and Visual Context (2024)\nDeciphering Urban Bike-Sharing Patterns\nAnother study, Deciphering Urban Bike-Sharing Patterns (2024), takes a different approach by examining how natural environment features and visual street characteristics relate to Citi Bike usage. The authors analyze how factors such as visibility, traffic-related visual elements, and urban form influence ridership patterns. Their results suggest that aspects of the surrounding environment, particularly those associated with motorized traffic, are negatively related to cycling activity. The study provides valuable insight into how the built environment shapes rider behavior, but it does not consider proximity to specific bike-lane types, such as protected versus shared lanes. In addition, the data used predates recent expansions of the Citi Bike network, and the analysis is not limited to Manhattan, which makes it harder to apply the results to the city’s most heavily used bike-share area.\n\n\nWeather and Citi Bike Usage (2019)\nWeather and Cycling in New York: The Case of Citi Bike\nWeather effects are explored more directly in Weather and Cycling in New York: The Case of Citi Bike (2019). This study shows that temperature and precipitation have a strong influence on ridership, even after accounting for factors such as land use, infrastructure, and calendar effects. The authors find that weather explains a substantial share of day-to-day variation in Citi Bike usage, often more than infrastructure or location alone. While this study highlights the importance of environmental conditions, it relies on older data from before major system expansions and does not examine how weather interacts with station-level context or lane proximity. As a result, it does not fully capture how weather and infrastructure jointly influence ridership in the current system.\n\n\nHow This Project Extends Prior Work\nTaken together, prior studies show that infrastructure, environmental conditions, and weather all influence bike-share ridership. However, these factors are often examined separately or summarized at a broad, system-wide level. This makes it difficult to understand how they interact at the locations where riders actually make decisions, such as individual stations in dense urban areas.\nThis project addresses those gaps by:\n\nCombining weather, time, rider type, and infrastructure\nRather than analyzing one factor at a time, this project jointly considers hourly temperature and precipitation, time-of-day and day-of-week patterns, rider type (member versus casual), and proximity to protected versus shared bike lanes. Studying these factors together allows the analysis to capture how they interact, such as how weather conditions may strengthen or weaken the effect of nearby infrastructure.\nFocusing on station-level outcomes\nInstead of relying on total system ridership, the analysis measures demand at individual stations. This approach captures meaningful variation across neighborhoods, where some stations experience substantially higher usage than others. Station-level analysis is especially important in Manhattan, where differences in location and infrastructure can lead to large differences in ridership.\nUsing recent data that reflects current network conditions\nThe analysis uses Citi Bike trip data from late 2024 through 2025, reflecting recent system expansion, increased e-bike availability, and updated bike-lane infrastructure. Earlier studies often rely on older data that may not represent current riding behavior, while this project captures how the system operates today.\nIsolating Manhattan, where density and infrastructure are most concentrated\nManhattan contains the highest density of Citi Bike stations, the greatest trip volumes, and a wide mix of protected and shared bike lanes within a compact area. By focusing exclusively on Manhattan, the project reduces noise from lower-density areas and allows for clearer comparisons across stations in a setting where bike-sharing plays a central role in daily transportation."
