<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overarching-question-oq">Overarching Question (OQ)</h2>
<p><strong>How do weather, time, location, bike lane infrastructure, and rider type affect Citi Bike trip volume in Manhattan?</strong></p>
<p>Citi Bike is part of everyday transportation in Manhattan. Riders use the system for commuting, short errands, recreation, and tourism. Because of this, ridership changes throughout the day, across seasons, and from one neighborhood to another. Understanding what drives these changes is useful for both planning and daily operations.</p>
<p>The OQ focuses on how several important factors work together to shape Citi Bike demand. No single factor explains the full pattern of ridership on its own. By studying each factor separately and then connecting them, we can better understand how the system behaves under different conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Key motivations for this question include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Helping planners understand when and where new bike lanes may have the greatest impact</li>
<li>Supporting Citi Bike operations by identifying predictable rush periods</li>
<li>Showing how weather shifts overall demand levels</li>
<li>Giving the public a clear explanation of what shapes bike availability</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="protected-bike-lanes-and-ridership-2025">Protected Bike Lanes and Ridership (2025)</h3>
<p><em>Effect of Protected Bike Lanes on Bike-Sharing Ridership</em></p>
<p>This study examines whether protected bike lanes lead to increased Citi Bike usage. Using a causal research design and several years of system-wide data, the authors find that ridership increases after protected lanes are installed. Their results provide strong evidence that safer infrastructure can encourage more people to use bike-share systems. However, the analysis focuses on overall ridership changes rather than how usage varies at individual stations. The study also does not incorporate weather conditions, making it difficult to separate the effects of infrastructure from environmental factors. As a result, while the findings support the importance of protected lanes, they leave open questions about how these effects play out in dense areas like Manhattan at a more detailed spatial level.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="urban-environment-and-visual-context-2024">Urban Environment and Visual Context (2024)</h3>
<p><em>Deciphering Urban Bike-Sharing Patterns</em></p>
<p>This next study takes a different approach by examining how natural environment features and visual street characteristics relate to Citi Bike usage. The authors analyze how factors such as visibility, traffic-related visual elements, and urban form influence ridership patterns. Their results suggest that aspects of the surrounding environment, particularly those associated with motorized traffic, are negatively related to cycling activity. The study provides valuable insight into how the built environment shapes rider behavior, but it does not consider proximity to specific bike-lane types, such as protected versus shared lanes. I</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weather-and-citi-bike-usage-2019">Weather and Citi Bike Usage (2019)</h3>
<p><em>Weather and Cycling in New York: The Case of Citi Bike</em></p>
<p>Finally, this study talks about how temperature and precipitation have a strong influence on ridership, even after accounting for factors such as infrastructure and calendar effects. The authors find that weather explains a substantial share of day-to-day variation in Citi Bike usage, often more than infrastructure or location alone. While this study highlights the importance of environmental conditions, it relies on older data predating system expansions and does not examine how weather interacts with station-level context or lane proximity.</p>

<section id="how-this-project-extends-prior-work" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-this-project-extends-prior-work">How This Project Extends Prior Work</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Combining weather, time, rider type, and infrastructure</strong><br>
Rather than analyzing one factor at a time, this project considers hourly temperature and precipitation, time-of-day and day-of-week patterns, rider type, and proximity to protected versus shared bike lanes. Studying these factors together allows the analysis to capture how they interact with each other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using recent data that reflects current network conditions</strong><br>
The analysis uses Citi Bike trip data from 2024 to 2025, reflecting recent system expansion, increased e-bike availability, and updated bike-lane infrastructure. Contrary to our study, earlier ones often rely on older data that may not be representative of current riding behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolating Manhattan, where density and infrastructure are most concentrated</strong><br>
Manhattan contains the highest density of Citi Bike stations, the greatest trip volumes, and a wide mix of protected and shared bike lanes within a compact area. By focusing exclusively on Manhattan, the project reduces noise from lower-density areas and allows for clearer comparisons across stations in a setting where bike-sharing plays a central role in daily transportation.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="most-popular-routes-findings">Most Popular Routes Findings</h2>
<p><img src="images/SQ1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Citi Bike demand is highly concentrated around a small number of Manhattan hubs, particularly near Central Park, major transit nodes, and waterfront corridors</p></li>
<li><p>The single most popular route — <em>Central Park S &amp; 6 Ave ↔︎ Central Park S &amp; 6 Ave</em> — recorded <strong>18,636 trips</strong>, exceeding most other routes</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Observed route counts do not capture unmet demand when docks or bikes are unavailable, so true demand concentration may be understated</p></li>
<li><p>High volumes may reflect station density and placement rather than rider preference for a specific location</p></li>
<li><p>Start–end data do not capture the actual path taken, limiting inference about street-level route choice</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implication:</strong><br>
Spatial results identify <em>where</em> demand concentrates, but not definitive evidence of preferred riding paths or infrastructure quality.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Temperature is the main weather driver of Citi Bike demand</p></li>
<li><p>The GAM curve shows a strong non-linear increase in trips between roughly <strong>40°F and 70°F</strong>, followed by a plateau, indicating diminishing gains from additional warmth</p></li>
<li><p>Precipitation suppresses demand, but less sharply than temperature:</p></li>
<li><p>Median trips consistently decrease from <em>None</em> → <em>Heavy</em> rain</p></li>
<li><p>Light rain days show comparable or slightly higher medians than dry days, suggesting commuter tolerance for mild precipitation</p></li>
